# Cyber Matters 

## 2: Digital footprints and where to find them

​	

​	As I started thinking about cyber issues more deeply as part of this course, I did what I think any sane person would—I Googled myself. I found mostly what I expected at first: my social media profiles (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.), my Github account, some photos and articles about me from my high school days, and results from a half marathon I ran recently. When I started to get into the depths of the Google search pages , though, I started to see things I wasn't quite ready for—my "discography" (a very brief feature on a song released by one of my high-school friends), the obituaries of my uncle and my grandmother, the results of all of my high school tennis matches and cross-country meets, and my birthday, to name a few.

###### But wait, I already share all of that information on my public Instagram account, easily accessible to anyone who might want it!

Hopefully, that will teach me to use my birthday as a password.



###### It's also easy to triangulate who my family members are from public obituaries

That's over half of my cousins represented. I was definitely surprised by exactly how easy it would be to come pretty close to mapping my entire family tree without my knowledge or permission (unlike through social media, where I ostensibly have some small level of control over who can look at my data). This also shows off exactly how silly it is to have a security question like "what was your mother's maiden name?" as a backup for any website login.

###### I also found out that my name is apparently the "perfect" first name for someone with the last name Pulsifer, though I'm not really sure what to make of that information.

#### Why do we care?

Of course, nothing in there was truly scandalous, but that's partly because I haven't spent much time living on my own, accumulating public data yet. What was really astounding was the sheer breadth and volume of the data I found—I never would have guessed, for example, that anyone was interested in keeping track of all of the finish times of cross-country runners from my high school, Christ School, but indeed there's a [site that does just that](https://www.athletic.net/CrossCountry/TeamRecords.aspx?SchoolID=9005&Grade=12). When I started snooping around, investigating what kind of data *might* be out there, I was shocked at the different kinds of data which are considered "public record" and are thus available to any citizen who can find the time to make a request of whichever government office might have said data. [Check Criminal Record.com](https://www.checkcriminalrecord.com/which-parts-of-your-personal-data-are-considered-public-record/) says the list is as follows:

- Your Name
- Birth Date
- Home and Mailing Addresses
- License Number
- Physical Description
- Social Security Number
- Failures to Appear in Court
- Failures to Pay Traffic Fines
- License Status (whether it’s valid, revoked, suspended, or expired, for example)
- Major traffic convictions stretching back 7 years (and minor traffic convictions stretching back 3 years)
- Birth Certificates
- Marriage Certificates
- Death Certificates
- Property Records
- Court Records
- Divorce Records
- Arrest Records
- Postal Address Information

Now you might ask—checkcriminalrecord.com? That doesn't sound like a very credible source, right? And that's definitely true, but the way that the not-so-credible sources define what's public record is the definition that you actually have to worry about, because these are the sites that are going to be least scrupulous about selling your data to the highest bidder, most notably to advertising agencies. And in fact, some states have even more lenient definitions of public record data. North Carolina, for example, defines "public record" in N.C. General Statue 132-1, as data "regardless of physical form and characteristics" which is "made  or received pursuant to law or ordinance in connection with the transaction of public business." North Carolina courts have maintained an extremely broad reading of the statute, deciding in *News and Observer Publishing Co. v. Wake County Hospital System Inc.* that the term includes any material kept in carrying out a government agency's lawful duties[^1].
